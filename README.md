# Brick-bot
A bot made by me to be toxic to someone, and also as a reply to them creating a bot to annoy me. More of as a meme than anything else. 

##Why did I create this bot?
No reason at all, to be honest. I literally made this on Notepad in the middle of night while I was on my sister's laptop. I can't imagine for this to be ever useful in my life or anyone's life except to piss Brick off. 

## Commands:
* &brick = Returns "Brick is a c--t."
* &cunt = Shows a picture of their profile picture in an embed with the title "Brick is a r-t--d that needs help"
* &predict = Shows how much **you** are a c--t in a scale of 1 to 10. Works with mentions.
* &help = Gives you all the command in an embed.

## What if I want to host this bot on my own?
I don't know why you would but you're free to take my code and host it on your own. Check this link out if you want: https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-hosting/, or check out the repository of an actual bot I'm developing right now called Smug Bear. There is an extremely detailed step-by-step process on how to host a bot. 

However, I do have the obligation to say that **this bot is online and public**. So you can invite to your discord servers, should you feel the need to. It's hosted in repl.it with a trick someone taught me so it's always online 24/7.

You can invite it here: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=812757117336420412&permissions=10240&scope=bot

Have fun being toxic :D
